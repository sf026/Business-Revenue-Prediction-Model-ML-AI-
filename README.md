Revenue Prediction Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts business revenue based on historical and operational data.
This project includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment-ready files.

 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust ML model that can accurately forecast revenue based on key business factors like sales, cost, product category, region, discounts, seasonal trends, and more.

This end-to-end workflow includes:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Handling missing values & outliers

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering for better accuracy

Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Hyperparameter tuning

Model evaluation

Saving the trained model (.pkl)

Deployment-ready prediction script

Data Preprocessing Steps

The notebook includes:

✔ Handling missing values
✔ Treating outliers
✔ Encoding categorical features
✔ Feature scaling using StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler
✔ Train-test split
✔ Correlation analysis to remove unnecessary columns

Exploratory Data Analysis

Key insights extracted from:

Revenue trend analysis

Feature correlation heatmap

Boxplots & histograms

Seasonal/quarterly patterns

Category-wise revenue comparison

EDA helps identify which variables most impact revenue.
